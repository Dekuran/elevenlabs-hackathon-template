      <p>
        This is a minimal static placeholder deployed from the
        <code>public</code> directory so Vercel has a valid output directory.
      </p>
      <p>
        The real Next.js app and API routes (in the <code>app/</code> and
        <code>app/api/</code> directories) are still present in the repository.
